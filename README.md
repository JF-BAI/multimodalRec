In the CRLMRec/preprocessing/ directory, we've provided the code for dataset processing. 
First, use this code to process your dataset. 
Once the dataset is processed, navigate to the CRLMRec/src/ directory. There, you can execute the command  `Python main.py --model model_name --dataset dataset_name`  to run the relevant program. Please replace model_name with the actual model name and dataset_name with the real dataset name according to your situation.
